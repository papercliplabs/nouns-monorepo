The Nouns DAO treasury receives 100% of ETH proceeds from daily Noun auctions. Each Noun is an irrevocable member of Nouns DAO and entitled to one vote in all governance matters. Noun votes are non-transferable (if you sell your Noun the vote goes with it) but delegatable, which means you can assign your vote to someone else as long as you own your Noun.":["Nouns DAO\u306f ",["compoundGovLink"]," \u306e\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30af\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001Nouns\u30a8\u30b3\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u4e3b\u8981\u306a\u7d71\u6cbb\u6a5f\u95a2\u3067\u3059\u3002\u6bce\u65e5\u8d77\u3053\u308bNoun\u30aa\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u5f97\u3089\u308c\u308bETH\u306e\u53ce\u76ca\u306e100\uff05\u306fNouns DAO \u30c8\u30ec\u30b8\u30e3\u30ea\u30fc\u306b\u3066\u53d7\u3051\u53d6\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5404Noun\u306fNouns DAO\u306e\u5909\u66f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u3059\u3079\u3066\u306e\u30ac\u30d0\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u554f\u984c\u30671\u7968\u306e\u6295\u7968\u6a29\u3092\u6709\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002Noun\u306e\u7968\u306f\u8b72\u6e21\u3067\u304d\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c (Noun\u306e\u58f2\u5374\u306b\u306f\u305d\u308c\u306b\u5fdc\u3058\u3066\u7968\u3082\u79fb\u308a\u307e\u3059)\u3001\u59d4\u4efb\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002"],"Nouns Protocol":"Nouns\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb","Nouns are an experimental attempt to improve the formation of on-chain avatar communities.
